<h1 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h1>
<h2 id="please-read-first">Please Read First</h2>
<p>If your looking for a simple example/use of singltone-like resources,
go to <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code>.</p>
<p>The whole point of the <code><a title="glazy.context.Context" href="#glazy.context.Context">Context</a></code> is to have a place to get shared resources.</p>
<p>Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:</p>
<p>Most of the time a resource will inherit from <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code> and that
class provides a class method <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource.resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource.resource">Resource.resource()</a></code> to easily get a
resource of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.</p>
<p>So normally, code would do this to get the current object instance for a Resource:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Resource):
&gt;&gt;&gt;    my_attribute = &quot;default-value&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to interact with current resource object:
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.resource().my_attribute = &quot;change-value&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Another convenient way to get the current resource is via the
<code>glazy.resource.ActiveResourceProxy</code>. This class lets you create an object
that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
and use it directly.</p>
<p>I would start with <a href="#fundamentals">Fundamentals</a> if you know nothing of how <code><a title="glazy.context.Context" href="#glazy.context.Context">Context</a></code> works
and want to learn more about how it works.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
<code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code>.
So getting familiar with Context is more about
utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important:&ensp;The below is for advanced use-cases and understanding.</p>
<p>Look at <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code> or docs just above ^^^ for the normal use-case and
examples / quick starts.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="context-overview">Context Overview</h1>
<p>Context is used to keep track of a set of resources. The resources are keyed off the class
type. IE: One resource per-context per-resource-type.</p>
<p>Main Classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a title="glazy.context.Context" href="#glazy.context.Context">Context</a></code>: Container of resources, mapped by type.</li>
<li>For Resource Subclasses:<ul>
<li><code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code>: Nice interface to easily get the current resource.
Used to implment a something that should shared and not generally duplicated,
like a soft-singleton.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h1>
<p><code><a title="glazy.context.Context" href="#glazy.context.Context">Context</a></code> is like a container, used to store various objects we are calling resources.</p>
<p>Used to store various resources of any type
in general [ie: configs, auths, clients, etc].
All of these resources together represent a sort of "context" from which various pieces of code
can easily get them; that way they can 'share' the resource when appropriate. This is a way
to do dependcy injection in a easier and more reliable way since you don't have to worry
about passing these resources around everywhere manually.</p>
<p>The values are mapped by their type.
When a resource of a specific type is asked for,
the Context will return it if it find it. If not found it will create it, add it to it's self
and return it. Future calls will return this new resource.</p>
<p><code><a title="glazy.context.Context" href="#glazy.context.Context">Context</a></code> can optionally have a parent. By default, a newly created/used Context will use
the current context Normally, resources are still normally created even if a
parent has a value, as long as the current context does not have one yet.</p>
<p>This behavior can be customized by the resource, see one of these for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code><ul>
<li>Useful for a shared/soft overridable shared object; where you can easily get the current
version of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>There are various ways to get resources from the current context. Let's say we have
a resource called <code>SomeResourceType</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; next_identifier = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResourceType(Resource):
...     def __init__(self):
...         global next_identifier
...         self.some_value = &quot;hello!&quot;
...         self.ident = next_identifier
...         next_identifier += 1
</code></pre>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note:&ensp;SomeResourceType's <code>ident</code> field get's incremented and set on each newly created object.</p>
<p>So the first SomeResoureType's <code>ident</code> will equal <code>0</code>,
the second one created will be <code>1</code> and so forth.</p>
</div>
<p>If what you want inherits from <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code>, it has a nice class method that
returns the current resource.
The easiest way to get the current resource for the type in this case is
to call <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource.resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource.resource">Resource.resource()</a></code> on it's type like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.resource().some_value
'hello!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.resource().ident
0
</code></pre>
<p>When a Context does not have the resource, by default it will create it for you, as you
saw in the previous example.</p>
<p><code><a title="glazy.context.Context.current" href="#glazy.context.Context.current">Context.current()</a></code> will return the current Context if no params are passed in, or if a
type is passed in, it will return the current Context's resource for the passed in type.</p>
<p>This means another way to grab resources is to get the current <code><a title="glazy.context.Context.current" href="#glazy.context.Context.current">Context.current()</a></code>,
and then ask it for the resource like below. This works for any type, including
types that don't inherit from <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; Context.current().resource(SomeResourceType).some_value
'hello!'
</code></pre>
<p>If you pass a type into <code><a title="glazy.context.Context.current" href="#glazy.context.Context.current">Context.current()</a></code>, it will do the above ^ for you:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; Context.current(SomeResourceType).some_value
'hello!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; Context.current(SomeResourceType).ident
0
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it still returns the same object [ie: <code>ident == 0</code>]</p>
<h2 id="activating-new-resource">Activating New Resource</h2>
<p>You can easily create a new resource, configure it however you like and then 'activate' it
so it's the current version of that resource.
This allows you to 'override' and activate your own copy of a resource.</p>
<p>You can do it via one of the below listed methods/examples below.</p>
<p>For these examples, say I have this resource defined:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; from dataclasses import dataclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; from glazy import Resource
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; @dataclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyResource(Resource):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     some_value = 'default-value'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; assert MyResource.resource().some_value == 'default-value'
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use desired <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code> subclass as a method decorator:<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; @MyResource(some_value='new-value')
&gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method():
&gt;&gt;&gt;     assert MyResource.resource().some_value == 'new-value'
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activating-new-context">Activating New Context</h2>
<p>When you create a new context, you can activate it to make it the current context in three ways
(listed below). Keep in mind that when you make a context current and 'activate' it,
it will implicitly <strong>copy</strong> it's self (so it's unattached from the orginal Context) and
the copy is what is made current/activated (see <code><a title="glazy.context.Context.__copy__" href="#glazy.context.Context.__copy__">Context.__copy__()</a></code> for more details if intrested).</p>
<ol>
<li>Via the <code>with</code> statement.</li>
<li>As a method dectorator, ie: <code>@</code>.</li>
<li>Permently activiating it via <code><a title="glazy.context.Context.make_current" href="#glazy.context.Context.make_current">Context.make_current()</a></code>, making it the new Default/Base
context in general.</li>
<li>When running a unit-test where glazy is installed as a dependcy,
because the <code>glazy.ptest_plugin.glazy_test_context</code> fixture is auto-used in this case.
This fixture creates a new Context with a None parent;
that will isolate resources between each run of a unit test method.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Here are examples of the four ways to create/activate a new context:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; with Context():
...     SomeResourceType.resource().ident
1
</code></pre>
<p>This is stack-able as well; as in this can keep track of a stack of contexts, in a
thread-safe way.</p>
<p>When the context manager or decorated method is exited, it will pop-off the context and it won't
be the default one anymore. Whatever the default one was before you entered the <code>with</code> will
be the default once more.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; @Context():
&gt;&gt;&gt; def a_decorated_method():
...     return SomeResourceType.resource().ident
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_decorated_method()
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_decorated_method()
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.resource().ident
0
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, after the method exits the old context takes over, and it already had the
older version of the resource and so returns that one.</p>
<p>By default, a context will create a resource when it's asked for it and it does not have it
already. As you saw above, every time a blank Context was created, it also created a new
SomeResourceType when it was asked for it because the new blank <code><a title="glazy.context.Context" href="#glazy.context.Context">Context</a></code> did not already
have the resource.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; Context().make_current()
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.resource().ident
4
</code></pre>
<p>With the context test fixture, it creates a brand new parent-less context every time a test runs
(see <code><a title="glazy.context.Context.parent" href="#glazy.context.Context.parent">Context.parent</a></code> for more about parents). You can use it like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; from glazy.fixtures import context
&gt;&gt;&gt; def test_some_text(context):
...    SomeResourceType.resource()
</code></pre>
<p>There are ways to share resource in a parent Context that a new blank context would beable
to use. But that's more advanced usage. The above should be enough to get you started quickly.
See below for more advanced usage patterns.</p>
<h1 id="parents">Parents</h1>
<p>A Context can have a parent (<code><a title="glazy.context.Context.parent" href="#glazy.context.Context.parent">Context.parent</a></code>) or event a chain of them (<code><a title="glazy.context.Context.parent_chain" href="#glazy.context.Context.parent_chain">Context.parent_chain()</a></code>)</p>
<p>Because it's the safest thing to do by default for naive resources, Context's normally don't
consult parents for basic resources, they will just create them if they don't already have them.</p>
<p>You can customize this behavior. There are some default resource base classes that will implment
a few common patterns for you. You can see how they work to get ideas, and customize the process
for your own resource when needed. See <a href="#resource-base-classes.">Resource Base Classes</a> below for
more details on how to do that.</p>
<p>You can make an isolated Context by doing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; Context(parent=None)
</code></pre>
<p>When creating a new context. This will tell the context NOT to use a parent. By default, a
Context will use the current Context as the time the Context was created as it's parent.
See <code><a title="glazy.context.Context.parent" href="#glazy.context.Context.parent">Context.parent</a></code> for more details.</p>
<p>This is also how the Context test fixture works (see <code>glazy.ptest_plugin.glazy_test_context</code>). It creates
a new parent-less context and activates it while the fixture is used.</p>
<h1 id="resource-base-classes">Resource Base Classes</h1>
<h3 id="resource"><code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code></h3>
<p>You can implment the singleton-pattern easily by inherting from the
<code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code> class.
This will try it's best to ensure only one resource is used amoung a chain/tree of parents.
It does this by returning <code>self</code> when <code><a title="glazy.context.Context" href="#glazy.context.Context">Context</a></code> asks it what it wants to do when a child-context
asks for the resource of a specific type.
Since <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code> can be shared amoung many diffrent child Context objects,
and makes the same instance always 'look' like it's the current one;
generally only one is every made or used.</p>
<p>However, you can create a new Context, make it current and put a diffrent instance of the
resource in it to 'override' this behavior.
See <a href="#activating-new-resource">Activating New Resource</a> for more details.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>I create a new class that uses our previous <a href="#resources">SomeResourceType</a> but adds in a
<code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; class MySingleton(SomeResourceType, Resource):
...     pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; MySingleton.resource().ident
5
</code></pre>
<p>Now watch as I do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; with Context():
...     MySingleton.resource().ident
5
</code></pre>
<p>The same resource is kept when making a child-context. However, if you make a parent-less
context:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; with Context(parent=None):
...     MySingleton.resource().ident
6
</code></pre>
<p>The <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code> will not see pased the parent-less context,
and so won't see the old resource.
It will create a new one. The <code><a title="glazy.resource.Resource" href="resource.html#glazy.resource.Resource">Resource</a></code> will still create it in the
furtherest parent it can&hellip; which in this case was the <code><a title="glazy.context.Context" href="#glazy.context.Context">Context</a></code> activated by the with statement.</p>

# To Do First:

If you have not already, to get a nice high-level overview of library see either:

- project README.md here:
    - https://github.com/xyngular/py-glazy#how-to-use
- Or go to glazy module documentation at here:
    - [glazy, How To Use](./#how-to-use)


# Quick Start

## Please Read First

If your looking for a simple example/use of singltone-like resources,
go to `glazy.resource.Resource`.

The whole point of the `Context` is to have a place to get shared resources.

Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

Most of the time a resource will inherit from `glazy.resource.Resource` and that
class provides a class method `glazy.resource.Resource.resource` to easily get a
resource of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

So normally, code would do this to get the current object instance for a Resource:

&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Resource):
&gt;&gt;&gt;    my_attribute = &#34;default-value&#34;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to interact with current resource object:
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.resource().my_attribute = &#34;change-value&#34;

Another convenient way to get the current resource is via the
`glazy.resource.ActiveResourceProxy`. This class lets you create an object
that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
and use it directly.

I would start with [Fundamentals](#fundamentals) if you know nothing of how `Context` works
and want to learn more about how it works.

Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
`glazy.resource.Resource`.  So getting familiar with Context is more about
utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

.. important:: The below is for advanced use-cases and understanding.
    Look at `glazy.resource.Resource` or docs just above ^^^ for the normal use-case and
    examples / quick starts.

# Context Overview

Context is used to keep track of a set of resources. The resources are keyed off the class
type. IE: One resource per-context per-resource-type.

Main Classes:

- `Context`: Container of resources, mapped by type.
- For Resource Subclasses:
    - `glazy.resource.Resource`: Nice interface to easily get the current resource.
        Used to implment a something that should shared and not generally duplicated,
        like a soft-singleton.

# Fundamentals

`Context` is like a container, used to store various objects we are calling resources.

Used to store various resources of any type  in general [ie: configs, auths, clients, etc].
All of these resources together represent a sort of &#34;context&#34; from which various pieces of code
can easily get them; that way they can &#39;share&#39; the resource when appropriate. This is a way
to do dependcy injection in a easier and more reliable way since you don&#39;t have to worry
about passing these resources around everywhere manually.

The values are mapped by their type.  When a resource of a specific type is asked for,
the Context will return it if it find it. If not found it will create it, add it to it&#39;s self
and return it. Future calls will return this new resource.

`Context` can optionally have a parent. By default, a newly created/used Context will use
 the current context Normally, resources are still normally created even if a
parent has a value, as long as the current context does not have one yet.

This behavior can be customized by the resource, see one of these for details:

- `glazy.resource.Resource`
    - Useful for a shared/soft overridable shared object; where you can easily get the current
        version of it.


## Resources
[resources]: #resources

There are various ways to get resources from the current context. Let&#39;s say we have
a resource called `SomeResourceType`:

&gt;&gt;&gt; next_identifier = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResourceType(Resource):
...     def __init__(self):
...         global next_identifier
...         self.some_value = &#34;hello!&#34;
...         self.ident = next_identifier
...         next_identifier += 1

.. note:: SomeResourceType&#39;s `ident` field get&#39;s incremented and set on each newly created object.
    So the first SomeResoureType&#39;s `ident` will equal `0`,
    the second one created will be `1` and so forth.

If what you want inherits from `glazy.resource.Resource`, it has a nice class method that
returns the current resource.
The easiest way to get the current resource for the type in this case is
to call `glazy.resource.Resource.resource` on it&#39;s type like so:

&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.resource().some_value
&#39;hello!&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.resource().ident
0

When a Context does not have the resource, by default it will create it for you, as you
saw in the previous example.

`Context.current()` will return the current Context if no params are passed in, or if a
type is passed in, it will return the current Context&#39;s resource for the passed in type.

This means another way to grab resources is to get the current `Context.current`,
and then ask it for the resource like below. This works for any type, including
types that don&#39;t inherit from `glazy.resource.Resource`:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Context.current().resource(SomeResourceType).some_value
&#39;hello!&#39;

If you pass a type into `Context.current`, it will do the above ^ for you:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Context.current(SomeResourceType).some_value
&#39;hello!&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Context.current(SomeResourceType).ident
0

As you can see, it still returns the same object [ie: `ident == 0`]

## Activating New Resource

You can easily create a new resource, configure it however you like and then &#39;activate&#39; it
so it&#39;s the current version of that resource.
This allows you to &#39;override&#39; and activate your own copy of a resource.

You can do it via one of the below listed methods/examples below.

For these examples, say I have this resource defined:

&gt;&gt;&gt; from dataclasses import dataclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; from glazy import Resource
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; @dataclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyResource(Resource):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     some_value = &#39;default-value&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; assert MyResource.resource().some_value == &#39;default-value&#39;

- Use desired `glazy.resource.Resource` subclass as a method decorator:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @MyResource(some_value=&#39;new-value&#39;)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method():
        &gt;&gt;&gt;     assert MyResource.resource().some_value == &#39;new-value&#39;

## Activating New Context

When you create a new context, you can activate it to make it the current context in three ways
(listed below). Keep in mind that when you make a context current and &#39;activate&#39; it,
it will implicitly **copy** it&#39;s self (so it&#39;s unattached from the orginal Context) and
the copy is what is made current/activated (see `Context.__copy__` for more details if intrested).

1. Via the `with` statement.
2. As a method dectorator, ie: `@`.
3. Permently activiating it via `Context.make_current`, making it the new Default/Base
   context in general.
4. When running a unit-test where glazy is installed as a dependcy,
    because the `glazy.ptest_plugin.glazy_test_context` fixture is auto-used in this case.
    This fixture creates a new Context with a None parent;
    that will isolate resources between each run of a unit test method.

### Examples

Here are examples of the four ways to create/activate a new context:

&gt;&gt;&gt; with Context():
...     SomeResourceType.resource().ident
1

This is stack-able as well; as in this can keep track of a stack of contexts, in a
thread-safe way.

When the context manager or decorated method is exited, it will pop-off the context and it won&#39;t
be the default one anymore. Whatever the default one was before you entered the `with` will
be the default once more.

&gt;&gt;&gt; @Context():
&gt;&gt;&gt; def a_decorated_method():
...     return SomeResourceType.resource().ident
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_decorated_method()
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_decorated_method()
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.resource().ident
0

As you can see, after the method exits the old context takes over, and it already had the
older version of the resource and so returns that one.

By default, a context will create a resource when it&#39;s asked for it and it does not have it
already. As you saw above, every time a blank Context was created, it also created a new
SomeResourceType when it was asked for it because the new blank `Context` did not already
have the resource.


&gt;&gt;&gt; Context().make_current()
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.resource().ident
4

With the context test fixture, it creates a brand new parent-less context every time a test runs
(see `Context.parent` for more about parents). You can use it like so:

&gt;&gt;&gt; from glazy.fixtures import context
&gt;&gt;&gt; def test_some_text(context):
...    SomeResourceType.resource()



There are ways to share resource in a parent Context that a new blank context would beable
to use. But that&#39;s more advanced usage. The above should be enough to get you started quickly.
See below for more advanced usage patterns.

# Parents

A Context can have a parent (`Context.parent`) or event a chain of them (`Context.parent_chain`)

Because it&#39;s the safest thing to do by default for naive resources, Context&#39;s normally don&#39;t
consult parents for basic resources, they will just create them if they don&#39;t already have them.

You can customize this behavior. There are some default resource base classes that will implment
a few common patterns for you. You can see how they work to get ideas, and customize the process
for your own resource when needed. See [Resource Base Classes][resource-base-classes] below for
more details on how to do that.

You can make an isolated Context by doing:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Context(parent=None)

When creating a new context. This will tell the context NOT to use a parent. By default, a
Context will use the current Context as the time the Context was created as it&#39;s parent.
See `Context.parent` for more details.

This is also how the Context test fixture works (see `glazy.ptest_plugin.glazy_test_context`). It creates
a new parent-less context and activates it while the fixture is used.

# Resource Base Classes
[resource-base-classes]: #resource-base-classes.

### `glazy.resource.Resource`

You can implment the singleton-pattern easily by inherting from the
`glazy.resource.Resource` class.
This will try it&#39;s best to ensure only one resource is used amoung a chain/tree of parents.
It does this by returning `self` when `Context` asks it what it wants to do when a child-context
asks for the resource of a specific type.
Since `glazy.resource.Resource` can be shared amoung many diffrent child Context objects,
and makes the same instance always &#39;look&#39; like it&#39;s the current one;
generally only one is every made or used.

However, you can create a new Context, make it current and put a diffrent instance of the
resource in it to &#39;override&#39; this behavior.
See [Activating New Resource](#activating-new-resource) for more details.

#### Example

I create a new class that uses our previous [SomeResourceType][resources] but adds in a
`glazy.resource.Resource`.

&gt;&gt;&gt; class MySingleton(SomeResourceType, Resource):
...     pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; MySingleton.resource().ident
5

Now watch as I do this:

&gt;&gt;&gt; with Context():
...     MySingleton.resource().ident
5

The same resource is kept when making a child-context. However, if you make a parent-less
context:

&gt;&gt;&gt; with Context(parent=None):
...     MySingleton.resource().ident
6

The `glazy.resource.Resource` will not see pased the parent-less context,
and so won&#39;t see the old resource.
It will create a new one. The `glazy.resource.Resource` will still create it in the
furtherest parent it can... which in this case was the `Context` activated by the with statement.

class _TreatAsRootParentType(Singleton):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Use `TreatAsRootParent`. This class is an implementation detail,
    to ensure that there is ever only one `TreatAsRootParent` value.
    I based this off how None works in Python [ie: a None + NoneType]
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    pass


_TreatAsRootParent = _TreatAsRootParentType()
&#34;&#34;&#34; Can be used for the parent of a new `Context`, it will make the context a root-like
    context. What this means is the parent is treated as if you set it to `None` while at the
    same time altering the copying/activating behavior.

    When you make a copy of a root-like `Context`, or use it in a `with` or `@` decorator
    which will also copy of the Context and activate the copy. When this happens the new context
    will use the currently activated context as it&#39;s parent.

    Normally when you pass in `None` as the parent of a new context, ie:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; Context(parent=None)

    New copies of that context object will have their parent set as None.

    For a root-like context created like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; Context(parent=_TreatAsRootParent)

    When activating this context, it will make a copy and have it&#39;s parent set as None.
    But if you then make another copy of this root-like context, the new context will
    have it&#39;s parent set to the Default/Current context instead of staying as None.

    The idea here is, if you pass in an explicit None, then we should always use None including
    in copied.  But root-like objects are a bit special, they have no parent because they are
    supposed to be the &#39;first&#39; one, and we don&#39;t necessarily want any copies of this
    root-like context to keep using `None`.

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        Read [Quick Start](#quick-start) first if you don&#39;t know anything about how `Context`
        works.

        Makes a **copy** of this Context object (which I will return), and makes that copy the
        current one the current thread until:

        1. Another Context object is made current.
        2. If while calling `make_current` the current context is temporary. Once the current
           context is not temporary anymore, the current context reverts back to what it was
           before that change happened. ie:

        .. note:: See `Context.__copy__` for more details on copying aspect.

        Example of this via a &#39;with&#39;`&#39; statement:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; before_context = Context.current()
        &gt;&gt;&gt; with Context() as my_context:
        ...    assert Context.current() is my_context
        ...    another_context = Context()
        ...    active_context_copy = another_context.make_current()
        ...    assert Context.current() is active_context_copy
        &gt;&gt;&gt; assert Context.current() is before_context

        Example of this via a &#39;@&#39; method decorator statement:

        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; before_int_resource_value = Context.current(for_type=int)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; method_context = Context(resources=[20])
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; # This dectorator will make a copy of `method_context` each time `my_method` is called.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @method_context
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method():
        ...     assert Context.current(for_type=int) == 20
        ...     another_context = Context(resources=[19])
        ...     another_context.make_current()
        ...     assert Context.current(for_type=int) == 19
        ...     # After method exits, due to `@method_context` the previous context
        ...     # state will be restored.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; assert Context.current(for_type=int) == before_int_resource_value

        ## Other Notes

        If you want to have a config object only temporarily current for the current thread,
        use it in a with statement:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; with Context() as my_context:
        ...     assert Context.current() is my_context
        ... assert Context.current() is not my_context

        Or as a method decorator:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; some_context = Context()
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @some_context:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method()
        ...     # Current context will be copy of `some_context` (with it&#39;s resources intact).

        If you use this method, it will make current permanently a copy of the &#39;current&#39; context.

        Normally you would avoid make a context &#39;permanet&#39; unless your trying to setup
        something special at the start of the application.

        Normally using the pre-allocated/existing permanet root context, or a temporary one via
        dectorator `@` / `with` statement is the way to go.

        Using `make_current` is more useful for situations where you are setting
        up a new &#34;default&#34; context for entire app, that you want everything in the project to
        generally use that would sit on top of the pre-allocated root-context.

            This method is called by `Context.make_current`, but will also pass back the reset

            Args:
                is_thread_root_context: This is simply a flag. You should have used the

                    We only ever have one of these, and it&#39;s always allocated at

            Right now this defaults to a unique number, that gets incremented each time a
            `Context` is created (in it&#39;s init method).

            May allow customization in the future.

        return self._name

    def __init__(
            self, __func=None, *,
            resources: Union[Dict[Type, Any], List[Any], Any] = None,
            parent: Union[DefaultType, _TreatAsRootParentType, None] = Default,

    ):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        You can give an initial list of resources
        (if desired, most of the time you just start with a blank context).

        for `parent`, it can be set to `guards.default.Default` (default value); or to `None.

        If you don&#39;t pass anything to parent, then the default value of `Default` will cause us
        to lookup the current context and use that for the parent automatically when the
        Context is activated.
        For more information on activating a context see
        [Activating A Context](#activating-a-context).

        If you pass in None for parent, no parent will be used/consulted. Normally you&#39;ll only
        want to do this for a root context. Also, useful for unit testing to isolate testing
        method resources from other unit tests. Right now, the unit-test resource isolation
        happens automatically via an auto-use fixture (`glazy.ptest_plugin.glazy_test_context`).

        A non-activated context will return `guards.default.Default` as it&#39;s `Context.parent`
        if it was created with the default value;
        otherwise we return `None` (if it was created that way).

        Args:
            resources (Union[Dict[Type, Any], List[Any], Any]): If you wish to have the
                `Context` your creating have an initial list of resources you can pass them
                in here.

                It can be a single resource, or a list of resources, or a mapping of resources.

                Mainly useful for unit-testing, but could be useful elsewhere too.

                They will be added to use via `Context.add_resource` for you.

                If you use a dict/mapping, we will use the following for `Context.add_resource`:

                - Dict-key as the `for_type&#39; method parameter.
                - Dict-value as the `resource` method parameter.

                This allows you to map some standard resource type into a completely different
                type (useful for unit-testing).

                By default, no resources are initially added to a new Context.

            parent (Union[guards.default.Default, _TreatAsRootParent, None]): If we should use
                `guards.default.Default`, treat this as a root-like Context, or use None as
                parent.

                Right now the only valid option is to do one of these three options:

                - nothing (ie: leave at `guards.default.Default`): If left as
                    `guards.default.Default`, We lookup current context and use that as the
                    parent in self and in copies or when self is used in a `with` statement or as
                    a decorator.
                - Pass `None`, indicating to not use any parent for current thread,
                    even if copied or used in a decorator/with-statement.
                    This means app-root, and any current thread-root will be ignored.
                - Pass `_TreatAsRootParent`, indicating to not use any parent, but allow copies
                    or when used as decorator/with-statement to use the currently activate
                    Context as the new copies parent.

                    This option should **ONLY** be used internally in this module.

                    If you use `_TreatAsRootParent` as the value, keep in mind that a root-like
                    Context is special, as it never has a parent and is also considered to have
                    a default parent if it&#39;s copied. A context is shallow copied, and the copy
                    activated when used as a decorator or in a `with` statement.

                    `_TreatAsRootParent ` should only be used INTERNALLY in this module,
                    it&#39;s not currently exposed publicly.

                    See `_TreatAsRootParent` for more details on root-like contexts.

            name (str): Optional name.
                If left as None, by default, this will simply assign a unique sequential
                number to the name.

                If name is passed in, it will be appended to the unique sequential number.

                When Context is printed in a string, it will include
                this as it&#39;s name to make debugging easier.

        Lets you add a resource to this context, you can only have one-resource per-type.

        Returns self so that you can keep calling more methods on it easily.... this allws you
        to also add a resource and then use it directly as decorator (only works on python 3.9),
        ie:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; # Only works on python 3.9+, it relaxes grammar restrictions
        &gt;&gt;&gt; #    (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0614/)
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @Context().add_resource(2)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     print(f&#34;my int resource: {Context.resource(int)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my int resource: 2&#34;

        As as side-note, you can easily add resources to a new `Context` via:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @Context(resources=[2])
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     print(f&#34;my int resource: {Context.resource(int)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my int resource: 2&#34;

        With the `Context.add_resource` method, you can subsitute resource for other
        resource types, ie:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     context = Context()
        ...     context.add_resource(3, for_type=str)
        ...     print(f&#34;my str resource: {Context.resource(str)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my str resource: 3&#34;

        If you need to override a resource, you can create a new context and set me as it&#39;s
        parent. At that point you can add whatever resources you want before anyone else
        uses the new `Context`.

        .. warning:: If you attempt to add a second resource of the same type...
            ...a `glazy.XynResourceError` will be
            raised. This is because other objects have already gotten this resource and are
            relying on it now.  You need to configure any special resources you want to add
            to this context early enough before anything else will need it.

        .. todo:: Consider relaxing this ^ and not producing an error [or at least an option
            to &#39;replace&#39; an existing resource in an existing Context. I was cautious on this
            at first because it was the safest thing to do and I could always relax it later
            if I found that desirable. Careful consideration would have to be made.

        Args:
            resource (Any): Object to add as a resource, it&#39;s type will be mapped to it.

            skip_if_present (bool): If False [default], we raise an exception if resource
                of that type is already in context/self.

                If True, we don&#39;t do anything if resource of that type is already in
                context/self.

            for_type: You can force a particular mapping by using this option.
                By default, the `for_type` is set to the type of the passed in resource
                [via `type(resource)`].

                You can override this behavior by passing a type in the `for_type` param.
                We will then map the resource for `for_type` to the `resource` object when
                a resource is requested for `for_type` in the future. Will still raise the
                error if a resource for `for_type` already exists in Context.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        resource_type = type(resource)

                return self
            # todo: complete/figure out comment!
            # if not rep
            raise XynResourceError(f&#34;Trying to add resource ({resource}), but already have one!&#34;)

        ## Summary

        The whole point of the `Context` is to have a place to get shared resources. This method
        is the primary way to get a shared resource from a Contet directly

        Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

        Normally a resource will inherit from `glazy.resource.Resource` and that
        class provides a class method `glazy.resource.Resource.resource` to easily get a
        resource of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

        So normally, code would do this to get a Resource:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Resource):
        &gt;&gt;&gt;    pass
        &gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to get current resource object:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.resource()

        Another convenient way to get the current resource is via the
        `glazy.resource.ActiveResourceProxy`. This class lets you create an object
        that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
        So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
        and use it directly.

        I would start with [Quick Start](#quick-start) if you know nothing of how `Context` works
        and want to learn more about how it works.

        Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
        `glazy.context.Resource`.  So getting familure with Context is more about
        utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

        ## Advanced Usage for Unit Tests

        You can allocate a new Context to inject or customize resources. When the context is
        thrown away or otherwise is not the current context anymore, the idea is whatever
        resource you made temporarily active is forgotten.

        You can inject/replace resources as needed for unit-testing purposes as well by simply
        adding the resource to a new/blank `Context` as a diffrent type, see example below.

        In this example, we add a value of int(20) for the `str` resource type.
        I used built-int types to simplify this, but you can image using your own
        custom-resource-class and placing it in the Context for the normal-resource-type
        the normal code asks for.

        &gt;&gt;&gt; Context().add_resource(20, for_type=str)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Context().resource(str)
        Output: 20

        ## Specific Details

        Given a type of `glazy.resource.Resource`, or any other type;
        we will return an instance of it.

        If we currently don&#39;t have one, we will create a new one of type passe in and return that.
        We will continue to return the one created in the future for the type passed in.

        You can customize this process a bit by having your custom resource inherit from
        `glazy.resource.Resource`.

        Otherwise, no other parameters will be sent to init method.

        If you have an `for_type` class of any sort
        that needs extra parameters and you want to use it as a Resource, you can create it
        yourself and add it to the Context via `add_resource`.  I would recommend in this case a
        class-method on the `for_type` class that would accept these extra parameters and then
        check the current Context and allocate or return the existing context resource as needed.

        Args:
            for_type (Type[ResourceTypeVar]): The type of resource you need, and instance of
                this type will be returned.

            create (bool): Whether to create resource if needed or not.
                If `True` [default]: creates the resource if it does not exist in self.
                If `False`: only returns an object if we have it already, otherwise None.

            use_parent (bool): Controls how the parent is used.

                If `False` [default]: we won&#39;t check the parent for the resource to return. We may
                still consult the parent in order to create a new resource from it; the use of
                the resource from parent is dependent on the resource. It has the option to decide
                what to do in this case. That&#39;s why this is False by default, it gives the option
                of what to do with the parent resource [if any] to the resource it&#39;s self. It has
                more knowledge about what it&#39;s situation is and can make a more informed decision.

                If `True`: and the resource is not directly in `self`, we will ask the parent
                `Context`; if we have a parent for the resource and return that if it&#39;s found.
                If a resource is found this way, we won&#39;t add it to `self` directly,
                only return it for you to use.

                If the resource is not in self and is not found in parent, then we will create it
                if `create=True` [default] and add that to `self` and return it.
                Otherwise, we return `None`.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # If we find it in self, use that; no need to check anything else.
        obj = self._resources.get(for_type, None)

        # then we check to see if resource is thread-sharable.
        # If it is then we continue as normal.
        # If NOT, then we always return None.
        # This will indicate to the thread-specific Context that is calling us to allocate
        # the object in it&#39;s self.
        # If something else is asking us, we still return None because this Resource does not
        # belong in us and so we should not accidently auto-create it in us.
        # ie: Whoever is calling is should handle the None case.
        #
        # In Reality, the only thing that should be calling the app-root context
        # is a thread-root context.  Thread root-contexts should never return None when asked

            subclass to find it&#39;s
            list of parent resources to consult on it&#39;s own.

            Real Example: `xyn_config.config.Config` uses this to construct it&#39;s parent-chain.

            while they are copied if needed via
            `glazy.resource.Resource.context_resource_for_copy`.

            We copy `Context` implicitly and make that copy the &#39;active&#39; context when it&#39;s made
            current/activated via a:

            - decorator `@`,
            - `with` statement,
            - or `Context.make_current`;

            Using one of the above with a Context also makes it &#39;active&#39;
            (see Context._is_active for more internal details, if your interested ).

            When a context is made current, it&#39;s sort of used as a &#39;template&#39;.
            That way it can be used over and over again without accumulating

        This allows us to support using `Context` as a function decorator in a few ways:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @Context
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
        ...     pass

        OR

        &gt;&gt;&gt; my_context = Context()
        &gt;&gt;&gt; my_context.add_resource(Resource())
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @my_context
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
        ...     pass

        In either case, we will create and activate NEW context each time `some_method` is called.
        It will be thrown away after the method is finished executing.

        This allows you to make whatever changes you wish to the Context while method is
        is running and it will start fresh again next time it runs.

        In the case of a pre-allocated context, such as `my_context` in the above example;
        we will use that as the template/starting-point each time `some_method` is called;

        What this means is that when `some_method` is called, and we create this new `Context`
        to use. The next `Context` will get the same resources that are/were assigned to it;
        whatever it is at the time `some_method` is called.

        This allows for more fine-control of what is in the `template` context, without
        worrying about taking other changes into it that come later.

    Used to create initial global state of app/thread-root contexts containers,
    which keep track of the visible `Contexts` on each thread, and for the app-root `Context`.

    Is also used by `glazy.pytest_plugin.glazy_test_context` auto-use fixture to blank/clear out
    all root/globally visible contexts by allocating the global-structures again and letting
    the old global structures deallocate.

    This allows for clean slate for each individual unit test run,
    in a way that does not really alter how Context works.

    It should work exactly the same as the normal, non-uniting app.
    We simply clear and allocate new root/global contexts at the start/end of each
    unit test run via the auto-use fixture.

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        Read [Quick Start](#quick-start) first if you don&#39;t know anything about how `Context`
        works.

        Makes a **copy** of this Context object (which I will return), and makes that copy the
        current one the current thread until:

        1. Another Context object is made current.
        2. If while calling `make_current` the current context is temporary. Once the current
           context is not temporary anymore, the current context reverts back to what it was
           before that change happened. ie:

        .. note:: See `Context.__copy__` for more details on copying aspect.

        Example of this via a &#39;with&#39;`&#39; statement:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; before_context = Context.current()
        &gt;&gt;&gt; with Context() as my_context:
        ...    assert Context.current() is my_context
        ...    another_context = Context()
        ...    active_context_copy = another_context.make_current()
        ...    assert Context.current() is active_context_copy
        &gt;&gt;&gt; assert Context.current() is before_context

        Example of this via a &#39;@&#39; method decorator statement:

        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; before_int_resource_value = Context.current(for_type=int)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; method_context = Context(resources=[20])
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; # This dectorator will make a copy of `method_context` each time `my_method` is called.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @method_context
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method():
        ...     assert Context.current(for_type=int) == 20
        ...     another_context = Context(resources=[19])
        ...     another_context.make_current()
        ...     assert Context.current(for_type=int) == 19
        ...     # After method exits, due to `@method_context` the previous context
        ...     # state will be restored.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; assert Context.current(for_type=int) == before_int_resource_value

        ## Other Notes

        If you want to have a config object only temporarily current for the current thread,
        use it in a with statement:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; with Context() as my_context:
        ...     assert Context.current() is my_context
        ... assert Context.current() is not my_context

        Or as a method decorator:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; some_context = Context()
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @some_context:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method()
        ...     # Current context will be copy of `some_context` (with it&#39;s resources intact).

        If you use this method, it will make current permanently a copy of the &#39;current&#39; context.

        Normally you would avoid make a context &#39;permanet&#39; unless your trying to setup
        something special at the start of the application.

        Normally using the pre-allocated/existing permanet root context, or a temporary one via
        dectorator `@` / `with` statement is the way to go.

        Using `make_current` is more useful for situations where you are setting
        up a new &#34;default&#34; context for entire app, that you want everything in the project to
        generally use that would sit on top of the pre-allocated root-context.

            This method is called by `Context.make_current`, but will also pass back the reset

        for `parent`, it can be set to `guards.default.Default` (default value); or to `None.

        to lookup the current context and use that for the parent automatically when the
        Context is activated.
        For more information on activating a context see
        [Activating A Context](#activating-a-context).

        If you pass in None for parent, no parent will be used/consulted. Normally you&#39;ll only

        method resources from other unit tests. Right now, the unit-test resource isolation
        happens automatically via an auto-use fixture (`glazy.ptest_plugin.glazy_test_context`).

        A non-activated context will return `guards.default.Default` as it&#39;s `Context.parent`

        otherwise we return `None` (if it was created that way).

        Args:

                It can be a single resource, or a list of resources, or a mapping of resources.

                Mainly useful for unit-testing, but could be useful elsewhere too.

                They will be added to use via `Context.add_resource` for you.

                If you use a dict/mapping, we will use the following for `Context.add_resource`:

                - Dict-key as the `for_type&#39; method parameter.
                - Dict-value as the `resource` method parameter.

                This allows you to map some standard resource type into a completely different
                type (useful for unit-testing).

                By default, no resources are initially added to a new Context.

            parent (Union[guards.default.Default, _TreatAsRootParent, None]): If we should use
                `guards.default.Default`, treat this as a root-like Context, or use None as
                parent.

                Right now the only valid option is to do one of these three options:

                - nothing (ie: leave at `guards.default.Default`): If left as
                    `guards.default.Default`, We lookup current context and use that as the
                    parent in self and in copies or when self is used in a `with` statement or as
                    a decorator.
                - Pass `None`, indicating to not use any parent for current thread,
                    even if copied or used in a decorator/with-statement.
                    This means app-root, and any current thread-root will be ignored.
                - Pass `_TreatAsRootParent`, indicating to not use any parent, but allow copies
                    or when used as decorator/with-statement to use the currently activate
                    Context as the new copies parent.

                    This option should **ONLY** be used internally in this module.

                    If you use `_TreatAsRootParent` as the value, keep in mind that a root-like
                    Context is special, as it never has a parent and is also considered to have
                    a default parent if it&#39;s copied. A context is shallow copied, and the copy
                    activated when used as a decorator or in a `with` statement.

                    `_TreatAsRootParent ` should only be used INTERNALLY in this module,
                    it&#39;s not currently exposed publicly.

                    See `_TreatAsRootParent` for more details on root-like contexts.

            name (str): Optional name.
                If left as None, by default, this will simply assign a unique sequential
                number to the name.

                If name is passed in, it will be appended to the unique sequential number.

                When Context is printed in a string, it will include
                this as it&#39;s name to make debugging easier.

        Lets you add a resource to this context, you can only have one-resource per-type.

        Returns self so that you can keep calling more methods on it easily.... this allws you
        to also add a resource and then use it directly as decorator (only works on python 3.9),
        ie:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; # Only works on python 3.9+, it relaxes grammar restrictions
        &gt;&gt;&gt; #    (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0614/)
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @Context().add_resource(2)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     print(f&#34;my int resource: {Context.resource(int)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my int resource: 2&#34;

        As as side-note, you can easily add resources to a new `Context` via:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @Context(resources=[2])
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     print(f&#34;my int resource: {Context.resource(int)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my int resource: 2&#34;

        With the `Context.add_resource` method, you can subsitute resource for other
        resource types, ie:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     context = Context()
        ...     context.add_resource(3, for_type=str)
        ...     print(f&#34;my str resource: {Context.resource(str)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my str resource: 3&#34;

        If you need to override a resource, you can create a new context and set me as it&#39;s
        parent. At that point you can add whatever resources you want before anyone else
        uses the new `Context`.

        .. warning:: If you attempt to add a second resource of the same type...
            ...a `glazy.XynResourceError` will be
            raised. This is because other objects have already gotten this resource and are
            relying on it now.  You need to configure any special resources you want to add
            to this context early enough before anything else will need it.

        .. todo:: Consider relaxing this ^ and not producing an error [or at least an option
            to &#39;replace&#39; an existing resource in an existing Context. I was cautious on this
            at first because it was the safest thing to do and I could always relax it later
            if I found that desirable. Careful consideration would have to be made.

        Args:
            resource (Any): Object to add as a resource, it&#39;s type will be mapped to it.

            skip_if_present (bool): If False [default], we raise an exception if resource
                of that type is already in context/self.

                If True, we don&#39;t do anything if resource of that type is already in
                context/self.

            for_type: You can force a particular mapping by using this option.
                By default, the `for_type` is set to the type of the passed in resource
                [via `type(resource)`].

                You can override this behavior by passing a type in the `for_type` param.
                We will then map the resource for `for_type` to the `resource` object when
                a resource is requested for `for_type` in the future. Will still raise the
                error if a resource for `for_type` already exists in Context.

        ## Summary

        The whole point of the `Context` is to have a place to get shared resources. This method
        is the primary way to get a shared resource from a Contet directly

        Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

        Normally a resource will inherit from `glazy.resource.Resource` and that
        class provides a class method `glazy.resource.Resource.resource` to easily get a
        resource of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

        So normally, code would do this to get a Resource:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Resource):
        &gt;&gt;&gt;    pass
        &gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to get current resource object:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.resource()

        Another convenient way to get the current resource is via the
        `glazy.resource.ActiveResourceProxy`. This class lets you create an object
        that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
        So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
        and use it directly.

        I would start with [Quick Start](#quick-start) if you know nothing of how `Context` works
        and want to learn more about how it works.

        Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
        `glazy.context.Resource`.  So getting familure with Context is more about
        utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

        ## Advanced Usage for Unit Tests

        You can allocate a new Context to inject or customize resources. When the context is
        thrown away or otherwise is not the current context anymore, the idea is whatever
        resource you made temporarily active is forgotten.

        You can inject/replace resources as needed for unit-testing purposes as well by simply
        adding the resource to a new/blank `Context` as a diffrent type, see example below.

        In this example, we add a value of int(20) for the `str` resource type.
        I used built-int types to simplify this, but you can image using your own
        custom-resource-class and placing it in the Context for the normal-resource-type
        the normal code asks for.

        &gt;&gt;&gt; Context().add_resource(20, for_type=str)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Context().resource(str)
        Output: 20

        ## Specific Details

        Given a type of `glazy.resource.Resource`, or any other type;
        we will return an instance of it.

        If we currently don&#39;t have one, we will create a new one of type passe in and return that.
        We will continue to return the one created in the future for the type passed in.

        You can customize this process a bit by having your custom resource inherit from
        `glazy.resource.Resource`.

        Otherwise, no other parameters will be sent to init method.

        If you have an `for_type` class of any sort
        that needs extra parameters and you want to use it as a Resource, you can create it
        yourself and add it to the Context via `add_resource`.  I would recommend in this case a
        class-method on the `for_type` class that would accept these extra parameters and then
        check the current Context and allocate or return the existing context resource as needed.

        Args:
            for_type (Type[ResourceTypeVar]): The type of resource you need, and instance of
                this type will be returned.

            create (bool): Whether to create resource if needed or not.
                If `True` [default]: creates the resource if it does not exist in self.
                If `False`: only returns an object if we have it already, otherwise None.

            use_parent (bool): Controls how the parent is used.

                If `False` [default]: we won&#39;t check the parent for the resource to return. We may
                still consult the parent in order to create a new resource from it; the use of
                the resource from parent is dependent on the resource. It has the option to decide
                what to do in this case. That&#39;s why this is False by default, it gives the option
                of what to do with the parent resource [if any] to the resource it&#39;s self. It has
                more knowledge about what it&#39;s situation is and can make a more informed decision.

                If `True`: and the resource is not directly in `self`, we will ask the parent
                `Context`; if we have a parent for the resource and return that if it&#39;s found.
                If a resource is found this way, we won&#39;t add it to `self` directly,
                only return it for you to use.

                If the resource is not in self and is not found in parent, then we will create it
                if `create=True` [default] and add that to `self` and return it.
                Otherwise, we return `None`.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # If we find it in self, use that; no need to check anything else.
        obj = self._resources.get(for_type, None)
        if obj is not None:
            return obj

        # If we are the root context for the entire app (ie: app-root between all threads)
        # then we check to see if resource is thread-sharable.
        # If it is then we continue as normal.
        # If NOT, then we always return None.
        # This will indicate to the thread-specific Context that is calling us to allocate
        # the object in it&#39;s self.
        # If something else is asking us, we still return None because this Resource does not
        # belong in us and so we should not accidently auto-create it in us.
        # ie: Whoever is calling is should handle the None case.
        #
        # In Reality, the only thing that should be calling the app-root context
        # is a thread-root context.  Thread root-contexts should never return None when asked

        &#34;&#34;&#34; Makes a copy of self, gives an opportunity for resources to do something special
            while they are copied if needed via
            `glazy.resource.Resource.context_resource_for_copy`.

            We copy `Context` implicitly and make that copy the &#39;active&#39; context when it&#39;s made
            current/activated via a:

            - decorator `@`,
            - `with` statement,
            - or `Context.make_current`;

            Using one of the above with a Context also makes it &#39;active&#39;
            (see Context._is_active for more internal details, if your interested ).

            When a context is made current, it&#39;s sort of used as a &#39;template&#39;.
            That way it can be used over and over again without accumulating
            resourced between runs. It will be &#39;fresh&#39; each time with whatever
            you added in the original &#39;template&#39;.

            Root and root-like contexts are treated special when it comes to copying with regard
            to how their parent values in their copies are treated.
            See `_TreatAsRootParent` for more details on this aspect.

        This allows us to support using `Context` as a function decorator in a few ways:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @Context
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
        ...     pass

        OR

        &gt;&gt;&gt; my_context = Context()
        &gt;&gt;&gt; my_context.add_resource(Resource())
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @my_context
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
        ...     pass

        In either case, we will create and activate NEW context each time `some_method` is called.
        It will be thrown away after the method is finished executing.

        This allows you to make whatever changes you wish to the Context while method is
        is running and it will start fresh again next time it runs.

        In the case of a pre-allocated context, such as `my_context` in the above example;
        we will use that as the template/starting-point each time `some_method` is called;

        What this means is that when `some_method` is called, and we create this new `Context`
        to use. The next `Context` will get the same resources that are/were assigned to it;
        whatever it is at the time `some_method` is called.

        This allows for more fine-control of what is in the `template` context, without
        worrying about taking other changes into it that come later.

    In either case, we will create and activate NEW context each time `some_method` is called.
    It will be thrown away after the method is finished executing.

    This allows you to make whatever changes you wish to the Context while method is

    What this means is that when `some_method` is called, and we create this new `Context`
    to use. The next `Context` will get the same resources that are/were assigned to it;
    whatever it is at the time `some_method` is called.

    This allows for more fine-control of what is in the `template` context, without

    Read [Quick Start](#quick-start) first if you don&#39;t know anything about how `Context`
    works.

    Makes a **copy** of this Context object (which I will return), and makes that copy the
    current one the current thread until:

    1. Another Context object is made current.
    2. If while calling `make_current` the current context is temporary. Once the current
       context is not temporary anymore, the current context reverts back to what it was
       before that change happened. ie:

    .. note:: See `Context.__copy__` for more details on copying aspect.

    Example of this via a &#39;with&#39;`&#39; statement:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; before_context = Context.current()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; with Context() as my_context:
    ...    assert Context.current() is my_context
    ...    another_context = Context()
    ...    active_context_copy = another_context.make_current()
    ...    assert Context.current() is active_context_copy
    &gt;&gt;&gt; assert Context.current() is before_context

    Example of this via a &#39;@&#39; method decorator statement:

    &gt;&gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; before_int_resource_value = Context.current(for_type=int)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; method_context = Context(resources=[20])
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; # This dectorator will make a copy of `method_context` each time `my_method` is called.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; @method_context
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method():
    ...     assert Context.current(for_type=int) == 20
    ...     another_context = Context(resources=[19])
    ...     another_context.make_current()
    ...     assert Context.current(for_type=int) == 19
    ...     # After method exits, due to `@method_context` the previous context
    ...     # state will be restored.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; assert Context.current(for_type=int) == before_int_resource_value

    ## Other Notes

    If you want to have a config object only temporarily current for the current thread,
    use it in a with statement:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; with Context() as my_context:
    ...     assert Context.current() is my_context
    ... assert Context.current() is not my_context

    Or as a method decorator:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; some_context = Context()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; @some_context:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method()
    ...     # Current context will be copy of `some_context` (with it&#39;s resources intact).

    If you use this method, it will make current permanently a copy of the &#39;current&#39; context.

    Normally you would avoid make a context &#39;permanet&#39; unless your trying to setup
    something special at the start of the application.

    Normally using the pre-allocated/existing permanet root context, or a temporary one via
    dectorator `@` / `with` statement is the way to go.

    Using `make_current` is more useful for situations where you are setting
    up a new &#34;default&#34; context for entire app, that you want everything in the project to
    generally use that would sit on top of the pre-allocated root-context.

    ## Summary

    The whole point of the `Context` is to have a place to get shared resources. This method
    is the primary way to get a shared resource from a Contet directly

    Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

    Normally a resource will inherit from `glazy.resource.Resource` and that
    class provides a class method `glazy.resource.Resource.resource` to easily get a
    resource of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

    So normally, code would do this to get a Resource:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Resource):
    &gt;&gt;&gt;    pass
    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to get current resource object:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.resource()

    Another convenient way to get the current resource is via the
    `glazy.resource.ActiveResourceProxy`. This class lets you create an object
    that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
    So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
    and use it directly.

    I would start with [Quick Start](#quick-start) if you know nothing of how `Context` works
    and want to learn more about how it works.

    Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
    `glazy.context.Resource`.  So getting familure with Context is more about
    utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

    ## Advanced Usage for Unit Tests

    You can allocate a new Context to inject or customize resources. When the context is
    thrown away or otherwise is not the current context anymore, the idea is whatever
    resource you made temporarily active is forgotten.

    You can inject/replace resources as needed for unit-testing purposes as well by simply
    adding the resource to a new/blank `Context` as a diffrent type, see example below.

    In this example, we add a value of int(20) for the `str` resource type.
    I used built-int types to simplify this, but you can image using your own
    custom-resource-class and placing it in the Context for the normal-resource-type
    the normal code asks for.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; Context().add_resource(20, for_type=str)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; Context().resource(str)
    Output: 20

    ## Specific Details

    Given a type of `glazy.resource.Resource`, or any other type;
    we will return an instance of it.

    If we currently don&#39;t have one, we will create a new one of type passe in and return that.
    We will continue to return the one created in the future for the type passed in.

    You can customize this process a bit by having your custom resource inherit from
    `glazy.resource.Resource`.

    Otherwise, no other parameters will be sent to init method.

    If you have an `for_type` class of any sort
    that needs extra parameters and you want to use it as a Resource, you can create it
    yourself and add it to the Context via `add_resource`.  I would recommend in this case a
    class-method on the `for_type` class that would accept these extra parameters and then
    check the current Context and allocate or return the existing context resource as needed.

    Args:
        for_type (Type[ResourceTypeVar]): The type of resource you need, and instance of
            this type will be returned.

        create (bool): Whether to create resource if needed or not.
            If `True` [default]: creates the resource if it does not exist in self.
            If `False`: only returns an object if we have it already, otherwise None.

        use_parent (bool): Controls how the parent is used.

            If `False` [default]: we won&#39;t check the parent for the resource to return. We may
            still consult the parent in order to create a new resource from it; the use of
            the resource from parent is dependent on the resource. It has the option to decide
            what to do in this case. That&#39;s why this is False by default, it gives the option
            of what to do with the parent resource [if any] to the resource it&#39;s self. It has
            more knowledge about what it&#39;s situation is and can make a more informed decision.

            If `True`: and the resource is not directly in `self`, we will ask the parent
            `Context`; if we have a parent for the resource and return that if it&#39;s found.
            If a resource is found this way, we won&#39;t add it to `self` directly,
            only return it for you to use.

            If the resource is not in self and is not found in parent, then we will create it
            if `create=True` [default] and add that to `self` and return it.
            Otherwise, we return `None`.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;

    # If we find it in self, use that; no need to check anything else.
    obj = self._resources.get(for_type, None)
    if obj is not None:
        return obj

    # If we are the root context for the entire app (ie: app-root between all threads)
    # then we check to see if resource is thread-sharable.
    # If it is then we continue as normal.
    # If NOT, then we always return None.
    # This will indicate to the thread-specific Context that is calling us to allocate
    # the object in it&#39;s self.
    # If something else is asking us, we still return None because this Resource does not
    # belong in us and so we should not accidently auto-create it in us.
    # ie: Whoever is calling is should handle the None case.
    #
    # In Reality, the only thing that should be calling the app-root context
    # is a thread-root context.  Thread root-contexts should never return None when asked
    # for a resource.
    # So, code using a Resource in general should never have to worry about this None case.
    if self._is_root_context_for_app:
        from glazy import Resource
        if issubclass(for_type, Resource) and not for_type.resource_thread_safe:
            return None

    parent_value = None
    parent = self.parent

    # Sanity check: If we are active we should have a None or an explicit, non-default parent.
    if self._is_active and parent is Default:
        XynResourceError(
            &#34;We somehow have a Context that has been &#39;activated&#39; but yet has &#34;
            &#34;their parent still set to `Default`. This is a bug. Active Context&#39;s &#34;
            &#34;should NEVER have their parent set at `Default`. It should either be None &#34;
            f&#34;or an explict parent Context instance, problem instance: {self}&#34;
        )

    # If we have a Default parent, then lookup current parent and use them for our &#39;Parent&#39;.
    if parent is Default:
        # An active parent&#39;s will never have their self._parent set as Default;
        # The current context is `active` along with it&#39;s parent-chain....
        # So this should be safe.
        # Doing an assert here to at least minimally double check this.
        parent = Context.current()
        assert self is not parent, &#34;Somehow have self and parent as same instance.&#34;

    if parent:
        parent_value = parent.resource(for_type, create=create)

    # If we can&#39;t create the resource, we can ask the resoruce to potetially create more of

<pre><code class="python">def resource_chain(
        self, for_type: Type[ResourceTypeVar], create: bool = False
) -&gt; Iterable[ResourceTypeVar]:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Returns a python generator yielding resources in self and in each parent;
    returns them in order.

    This won&#39;t create a resource if none exist unless you pass True into `create`, so it&#39;s
    possible for no results to be yielded if it&#39;s never been created and `create` == False.

    .. warning:: This is mostly used by `glazy.resource.Resource` subclasses
        (internally).

        Not normally used elsewhere. It can help the glazy.resource.Resource`
        subclass to find it&#39;s
        list of parent resources to consult on it&#39;s own.

        Real Example: `xyn_config.config.Config` uses this to construct it&#39;s parent-chain.

    Args:
        for_type (Type[ResourceTypeVar]): The resource type to look for.
        create (bool): If we should create resource at each context if it does not already
            exist.
    Yields:
        Generator[ResourceTypeVar, None, None]: Resources that were found in the self/parent
            hierarchy.

        resource = context.resource(for_type=for_type, create=create)
